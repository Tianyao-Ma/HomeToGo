## ðŸŽ¬ About the project
<p align="justify"> 
  Online homestay rental applications like Airbnb have created a big revolution in the travel industry since it started operating. All over the world, travelers are abandoning over-priced hotels in favor of smaller and more homely accommodation. How do they manage to create authentications and authorizations for both users and hosts? How do they design the database to store all the media files like posts and reviews? How do they track the availability of the rooms and dates? And what's the secret that allows users to to search all places around the world?
   
This project recreated the online rental system with SpringBoot and ReactJs. The data generated by users and hosts are efficiently managed by MySQL and GCE. Registered hosts can upload lists, update and delete lists, while users can search lists with selected locations and make reservations.
